# Footwork Recognition
Repository for development of action recognition model for fencing video data. 

Following the work done in [Video Pose Distillation](https://github.com/jhong93/vpd). 

Fencer detection, tracking, and pose estimation script for extracting crops and pose features prior to use in the VPD network, found in [create_boxes_file.py](https://github.com/Carpfire/fencing_cv/blob/main/create_boxes_file.py).

Current Action Recognition code is in proj file. Contains dataloaders.py, models.py and experiment.py. Demo notebook of training and evaluation found at [baseline.ipynb](https://github.com/Carpfire/footwork_recognition/blob/main/src/baseline.ipynb)
